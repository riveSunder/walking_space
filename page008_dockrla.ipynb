    "### Reinforcement Learning is a problem formulation where an *agent* interacts with an *environment* by choosing *actions* based on the *observations* (and *rewards*) generated by the environment. \n",

    "I (partially) re-implemented the optimization experiment from Bjerrum's docking optimization paper, using covariance matrix adaptation evolution instead of particle swarm optimization and a few different parametrizations of the optimization problem (direct optimizatino of Smina objective function weights, a multilayer perceptron to generate the weights, and a naive graph neural network). \n",
